I've upgraded my laptop today, that included Google Chrome, and surprise, surprise, when it restarted, it started telling me that the uBlock Origin extension is no longer supported and will be disabled. I'm paying for YouTube Premium, but I still can't live without ad blocker. It turns out you can just enable the extension again and it will keep working, but for how long. So I decide to switch. I've been using Chrome from the very early times, long before it was mainstream. The more popular Chrome was, the more hostile Google was. Now removing my ad blocker, that's just saying they don't want me to use their browser. That's OK, now we have alternatives, even with ad blockers built in. My first choice would have been Opera, but unfortunately 1Password doesn't support it, so I went to the next best option, Brave. So far, I'm pretty happy with it.
