I've decided to learn a new programming language, as a kind of therapy, and I can't really do that without a specific project.
I wanted to rewrite AcoustID indexing server for many years, I have multiple unfinished copies. Purely out of curiosity,
I decided to use it to learn Zig. It's not a perfect fit, Zig is too low level for my use case, Rust or C++ would be better
suited for this, but I wanted to give it a try.

## The Good Parts

Zig is simple.

Zig has the best error handling in any language I've used so far.

## Wishes

There a few things that would make Zig excellent language, in my opinion.

The top one are interfaces. Zig has a concept of `anytype` which is like duck-typing during compilation, which allows many things, but I'd like to be more specific.
